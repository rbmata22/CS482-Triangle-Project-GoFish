After completing our second sprint, we shifted our focus in the third sprint towards prioritizing the main game functionality and refining the features we had already implemented. Rather than adding new major stories, we concentrated on polishing existing components, such as improving the shop functionality and enhancing the styling of various game elements to create a cohesive and visually appealing experience. This approach allowed us to dedicate time to ensuring the game was fully functional and ready for demonstration. Aside from the ongoing technical tasks, including documentation and styling, our efforts were directed toward fine-tuning and debugging to make the game demo-able. This sprint marked a shift in strategy, emphasizing quality over quantity by focusing on delivering a stable, polished product.
