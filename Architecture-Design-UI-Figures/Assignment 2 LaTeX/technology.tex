The application will leverage a powerful stack of modern web technologies. Firebase Authenticaiton will handle user authentication, allowing players to securely sign up, log in, and manage their accounts. Firestore, Firebase's flexible and scalable NoSQL database, will store and synchronize game data in real-time. This includes player information, game states, and card decks to ensure users experience changes in real-time.\\ 

Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framewor that will serve as our backend. It will handle tasks such as HTTP requests, routing, and API endpoints to act as an intermediary between the client-side application and Firestore.\\

Whereupon Node.js will power the server-side logic, enabling efficient handling of concurrent connections and real-time updates.
