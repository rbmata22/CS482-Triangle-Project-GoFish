\section{Coding Standards}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use Camel Case for naming conventions (e.g., thisExampleHere)
    \item Write meaningful commit messages
    \item Include class and method descriptions
    \item Add inline comments for clarity
    \item Follow a clear and concise document structure for Firebase 
    \item Implement uniform error handling throughout the project
    \item For Firebase, prioritize authentication through secure endpoints for all database interactions
    \item For Java, ensure each class represents a single responsibility
    \item Prioritize efficiency within the code
\end{itemize}

Our coding standard follows several key principles, ranging from the simple usage of camel casing for naming conventions to ensuring meaningful commit messages. 

Each class and method should include clear descriptions, and inline comments should be used for better code readability. A clear and concise document structure is required for Firebase integration, with consistent error handling throughout the project.

For Firebase, secure endpoints must be prioritized for all authentication and database interactions. In Java, each class should adhere to the single-responsibility principle. Lastly, efficiency within the code is a top priority. For example, repeated lines of code will be made into a function and variables that can be grouped will be made into objects.
