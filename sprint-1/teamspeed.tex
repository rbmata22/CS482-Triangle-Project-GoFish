\subsection{Spikes}
In terms of spikes, we ran into many obstacles throughout this first sprint. Most recently we had troubles with Jest and testing our application. While we were able to install the necessary packages and test basic functions, we were unable to test the actual functions of the application and thus we were only able to create a rough draft of the testcases we would have run had we gotten Jest to work. Furthermore, we ran into trouble within GitHub as we were all working on the same repository. While we were able to create branches off of the main branch and work on our own tasks, we ran into a lot of merge conflicts and even problems with committing and pushing to the main branch in general. Another problem we ran into was retrieving from and updating our database, whether this be account creation/logging in and out of an account or setting up a listener for the database to send and receive private messages.
