Jest was giving issues with installation, so heres some test cases we had
(10 minutes before due)

1. Tested Login features: incorrect email formats, signin with google when
theres no account, when there IS and account, etc.

2. Tested SignUp features: incorrect email formats, signup with google, 
when you signup when you already have an account associated

3. Tested Guest features: Checks if document is deleted upon logging out


For future testing, we will provide error checking for instances where
a username is already taken.
