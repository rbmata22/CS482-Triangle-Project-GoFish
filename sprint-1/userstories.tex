\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{S2: Joining as Guest} \\

    Players can now customize their accounts and have some sense of personalization while playing.

    Allowing for moderation and a sense of order while playing the game. Also helps in getting admin support if a user needs it.
\end{itemize}

After receiving feedback for our first submission of user stories we realized that there was more work to be done. Thus, we added new stories and reviewed old ones in order to improve their relevancy to the users and overall quality. Some of the new user stories that were added include making a guest account, new admin capabilities, and having a friends list. 

The reasoning behind these changes is to allow players to participate in a session without the need to create an account and for them to have better customization and overall features. The inclusion of enhanced admin features such as banning accounts improves the platformâ€™s moderation capabilities, ensuring a safer gaming environment.

Some of the old stories that underwent change were having a card deck, games running concurrently, creating private and public lobbie, and messaging. This structure improves the clarity of the user flow and establishes a more logical sequence for tasks. 

It also assists in enhancing the clarity and usability of the descriptions, thus, helping developers and stakeholders understand functionality better. With improving messaging and the creation of lobbies, it is important for enhancing social features which promotes player interaction and retention. These changes improve the clarity of the user flow and establish a more logical sequence for tasks. \\
