\section{Abstract}
The Bui’s Bayside Inn project was created in response to a request from Dr. Bui for an online platform that combines the simplicity of the classic card game Go Fish with modern multiplayer and social features. Developed as part of the CS482 course, the project offers players an engaging experience with options to create accounts, customize profiles, and join private or public lobbies. A virtual currency system adds excitement by allowing players to bet on matches and purchase profile upgrades. Social features such as a friend system, private messaging, and public chat lobbies encourage player interaction, while administrative tools ensure a safe and welcoming environment for all users. Built using React and Firebase, the platform is designed to be visually appealing and user friendly, with features like win and loss tracking and a tutorial mode for new players. By combining classic gameplay with online functionality, the Bui’s Bayside Inn project brings Dr. Bui’s vision of a fun card game to life.
