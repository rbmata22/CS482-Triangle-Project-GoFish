\section{Persistence}
For our project, we use Firebase Firestore, a NoSQL cloud-based database, to store persistent data. Firestoreâ€™s scalability and real time capabilities made it a suitable choice for handling the dynamic requirements of our multiplayer platform. Our collections include users, lobbies, games, chatLogs, and adminLogs, each tailored to specific functionalities. The users collection stores information about player accounts, including attributes such as userID, username, email, passwordHash, profileIcon, currency, and friendList. The lobbies collection manages active game sessions and includes attributes like lobbyID, hostID, playerIDs, gameMode, and betAmount. For gameplay details, the games collection tracks attributes like gameID, lobbyID, deckState, playerHands, turnOrder, and gameStatus.Chat data is stored in the chatLogs collection, which includes chatID, lobbyID, senderID, messageContent, and timestamp. Finally, the adminLogs collection records administrative actions, such as logID, adminID, actionType, targetUserID, and timestamp. These collections and their attributes evolved over the course of the semester as we refined our design and requirements.
