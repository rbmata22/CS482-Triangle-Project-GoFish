\subsubsection{UI Description}

The following figures showcase the user interface screenshots for our application. Each screenshot highlights a key feature or design aspect. The game begins with a login screen where users can either log in, create an account, or join as a guest, allowing flexibility for both returning and new players. Once logged in, users are presented with a main menu that serves as a hub for navigating the platform. From here, they can access key features like creating or joining game lobbies, visiting the shop to purchase customizations, messaging the admin or starting a tutorial to learn the gameplay. Players choosing to join as guests can also select an avatar for personalization before entering the main menu. To start a game, users can create a public or private lobby, specifying the game mode and player limit. Alternatively, they can join an existing lobby using a code or search for open lobbies. Once in the lobby, players are matched with others, and the game begins. The in game interface provides a clear view of the player's cards, turn order, and actions, such as selecting a player and asking for a card. The game flow ensures a smooth and engaging experience.
