\noindent This sprint brought a lot of challenges, especially around getting the actual game to work smoothly. With so many moving parts, like the betting system and making sure two real players could interact properly, it was tough to get everything synced up. One of the biggest hurdles was figuring out how to keep the game state consistent for both players, so their actions lined up in real time without glitches. The betting feature added another layer of complexity, since it had to work seamlessly with the gameplay and backend. It felt like every little change made had a ripple effect on other parts of the game, making progress slower than expected.

\noindent After completing our second sprint, we shifted our focus in the third sprint towards prioritizing the main game functionality and refining the features we had already implemented. Rather than adding new major stories, we concentrated on polishing existing components, such as improving the shop functionality and enhancing the styling of various game elements to create a cohesive and visually appealing experience. This approach allowed us to dedicate time to ensuring the game was fully functional and ready for demonstration. Aside from the ongoing technical tasks, including documentation and styling, our efforts were directed toward fine-tuning and debugging to make the game demo-able. This sprint marked a shift in strategy, emphasizing quality over quantity by focusing on delivering a stable, polished product.
