After receiving feedback for our first submission of user stories we realized that there was more work to be done. Thus, we added new stories and reviewed old ones in order to improve their relevancy to the users and overall quality. Some of the new user stories that were added include making a guest account, new admin capabilities, and having a friends list. 

The reasoning behind these changes is to allow players to participate in a session without the need to create an account and for them to have better customization and overall features. The inclusion of enhanced admin features such as banning accounts improves the platformâ€™s moderation capabilities, ensuring a safer gaming environment.

Furthermore, with regards to this second sprint, we were able to accomplish a lot more user stories than before. After getting a feel for the first sprint, we went through and got to work on many user stories. As well as fixing up previous ones that needed mending. Stories highlighted in blue underwent significant changes or were enhanced even further than the requirements.
