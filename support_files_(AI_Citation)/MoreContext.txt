Silas - I've been to HopHacks and HackUMBC where i made web apps, so i 
used a lot of the logic i used in those experiences as my terminology when it came to
the creation of the App, SignUp, Login and Guest. I also created side 
projects that handled route redirection using "react-router-dom", hence why
I used that to handle the redirection of the pages.

The results from AI was wrong 99% of the time, so i did a lot of editing/research
on my own then sent it the code that i updated, and i would incrementally
make process on the files based on that back and forth. For example,
Home would incorrectly prioritize logged in users that were previously logged
in versus someone who logs in as a guest. So i did research on my own trying
to figure out how to handle the homepage for ANY OPTION, and removed the 
priority of some entry points over others
